title:  Research assistant in Conflict Research with Focus on Forecasting and Machine Learning
---

Are there recurring patterns in the escalation and emergence of wars? The idea that history may repeat itself is old. But recent advances overcoming methodological and data barriers present an opportunity to identify these recurrences empirically and to examine whether these patterns can be classified to improve forecasts and inform theories of conflict. In this project, we will combine new methods and novel data on conflict from finance, diplomatic cables, and newspapers, to extract typical pre war motifs. Just as DNA sequencing has been critical to medical diagnoses, PaCE aims to diagnose international politics by uncovering the relevant patterns in the area of conflict (more details at [forecastlab.org](http://www.forecastlab.org)).

The post-holder will work in an exciting environment alongside a highly creative and motivated team, to acquire and analyse time series data from pre-conflict environments (both interstate and civil war), and apply recent machine learning techniques to forecasting the onset of these events.

# Expected start date
September 2021

# Standard Duties and Responsibilities

The holder of the position is to pursue a project that uses machine-learning methods to forecast interstate and civil wars. In particular, the team member will:

-   Acquire and process time series data from finance, diplomatic cables, and news reports 
- Contribute to the development of an early warning system for conflict 
- Participate in the team's publications (to be determined)


# Person Specification
## Qualifications

A strong undergraduate degree or Masters in computer science (engineering, physics also welcome), political science, economics or a relevant field (e.g., first or upper second for Irish or UK applicants; GPA 3.3+ for US applicants).


## Knowledge & Experience

-   Knowledge of R and/or Python (highly desirable)
-   Background in statistics and/or econometrics (highly desirable)
-   Familiarity with Github (desirable)
