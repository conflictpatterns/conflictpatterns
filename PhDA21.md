title:  PhD Studentship in Conflict Research with Focus on Forecasting and Machine Learning
---

Are there recurring patterns in the escalation and emergence of wars? The idea that history may repeat itself is old. But recent advances overcoming methodological and data barriers present an opportunity to identify these recurrences empirically and to examine whether these patterns can be classified to improve forecasts and inform theories of conflict. In this project, we will combine new methods and novel data on conflict from finance, diplomatic cables, and newspapers, to extract typical pre war motifs. Just as DNA sequencing has been critical to medical diagnoses, PaCE aims to diagnose international politics by uncovering the relevant patterns in the area of conflict (more details at [forecastlab.org](http://www.forecastlab.org)).

The post-holder will work in an exciting environment alongside a highly creative and motivated team, to acquire and analyse time series data from pre-conflict environments (both interstate and civil war), and apply recent machine learning techniques to forecasting the onset of these events.

# Expected start date
September 2021

# Standard Duties and Responsibilities

The holder of the position is to pursue a project that uses machine-learning methods to forecast interstate and civil wars. In particular, the team member will:

-   Acquire and process time series data from finance, diplomatic cables, and newspapers 
- Apply Machine Learning methods using Python/R 
- Work on the classification of temporal patterns 
- Contribute to the development of an early warning system for conflict 
-   Contribute to the growth of the methodological and substantive expertise of the team
-   Participate in the team's publications


# Person Specification
## Qualifications

A strong undergraduate degree or Masters in computer science (engineering, physics also welcome), political science, economics or a relevant field (e.g., first or upper second for Irish or UK applicants; GPA 3.3+ for US applicants).


## Knowledge & Experience

-   Excellent knowledge of R and/or Python (highly desirable)
-   Background in statistics and/or econometrics (highly desirable)
-   Knowledge of machine learning (desirable)
-   Familiarity with Social Sciences (desirable)
-   Familiarity with the development of statistical packages and deployment on github (desirable)


## Skills & Competencies

-   Ability to write clearly and concisely
-   Enthusiasm to acquire expertise in new fields and methods
-   Enthusiasm to share expertise with other team members
-   Enthusiasm for communication with a broader audience


# Supervision

The studentship will be supervised by Professor [Thomas Chadefaux](http://www.thomaschadefaux.com). Students will be enrolled in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/)  [PhD Programme](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/postgraduate/phd-programme/)  at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie).


# Funding

This project is funded by the PaCE ERC Consolidator Grant 101002240 (2022-26) and is hosted at the Department of Political Science at Trinity College Dublin.

Students will receive an annual stipend of €18,300 for four years. Continuation on the PhD register  is conditional on the candidate's successful progression through the PhD requirements. The team member's stipend will be conditional on satisfactory performance in the team.
